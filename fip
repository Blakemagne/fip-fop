# fip â€” copy stdin or file contents to the system clipboard (Linux, macOS, WSL)
#
# This script provides a unified interface for clipboard operations across different
# Unix-like operating systems. It automatically detects and uses the appropriate
# clipboard tool for the current environment.

# Enable strict error handling
# -e: Exit immediately if any command returns non-zero status
# This ensures the script fails fast on errors instead of continuing with undefined behavior
set -e

# CLIPBOARD BACKEND DETECTION
# The script checks for clipboard tools in order of preference:
# 1. wl-copy (Wayland) - Modern Linux desktop protocol
# 2. xclip (X11) - Traditional Linux windowing system
# 3. pbcopy (macOS) - Apple's clipboard utility
# 4. clip.exe (WSL) - Windows Subsystem for Linux integration

# Check for Wayland clipboard tool
# command -v: POSIX-compliant way to check if a command exists
# >/dev/null 2>&1: Discard both stdout and stderr output
if command -v wl-copy >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # wl-copy is part of wl-clipboard package for Wayland compositors
  CLIP_CMD="wl-copy"
  
# Check for X11 clipboard tool
elif command -v xclip >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # xclip requires explicit selection of clipboard buffer
  # -selection clipboard: Use the CLIPBOARD buffer (Ctrl+C/V) not PRIMARY (middle-click)
  CLIP_CMD="xclip -selection clipboard"
  
# Check for macOS clipboard tool
elif command -v pbcopy >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # pbcopy is included by default on all macOS systems
  CLIP_CMD="pbcopy"
  
# Check for WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
# This is a two-part check:
# 1. grep -qi microsoft /proc/version: Check if running under WSL
#    -q: Quiet mode (no output)
#    -i: Case-insensitive match
#    /proc/version contains kernel version info, WSL kernels contain "microsoft"
# 2. command -v clip.exe: Verify Windows clipboard tool is accessible
elif grep -qi microsoft /proc/version && command -v clip.exe >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # clip.exe is the Windows clipboard utility, accessible from WSL
  # Note: clip.exe only supports copying TO clipboard, not reading from it
  CLIP_CMD="clip.exe"
  
# No suitable clipboard tool found
else
  # printf is more portable than echo for error messages
  # >&2: Redirect to stderr (file descriptor 2)

  # Exit with error status

# 1. No arguments: Read from stdin (pipe mode)
# 2. One argument: Read from file
